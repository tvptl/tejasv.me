                <p>
                        As a Product Specialist, I provide day to day functional and technical software application support to Cornerstone clients via telephone and written communication. Using my deep understanding of Cornerstone applications including the hundreds of complex features and configuration options, I am to take a data driven approach to grasp clients’ complex system workflows so that I can discern the cause and effect for actions in order to troubleshoot issues while validating between user errors and actual system defects with the latter being sent up to analyst and engineering teams for further investigation and action.

                <p>
                        As a product specialist, I provided tier one customer support and ensured resolution of issues by following through with the appropriate processes. I worked with the sales team to on board new clients and implement their integration preferences with our platform. Amidst on boarding and supporting clients, I documented the features, setup and basic troubleshooting processes for the various partners integrated with our platform for both internal and client facing use. Additionally, I coordinated with the development team before and after releases to acceptance test new features and report any issues using JIRA to comment, report and pass tickets.

I also provided support to customer services/sales team by qualifying members to maximize conversions in addition to working on various projects to improve workflow and processes to enable greater efficiency within the operations team.                </p>
